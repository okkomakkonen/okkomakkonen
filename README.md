## Hello there 👋 I am Okko Makkonen

I am a third year Mathematics student in Aalto University, Finland 🇫🇮. My passions include all kinds of maths from analysis to algebra 🧮, computer science and programming 🤖. I love to learn new things within all kinds of subjects, and I always try to find new and interesting things 🤔.
